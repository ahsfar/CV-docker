# CV

This is my CV Project I used it to practice and created the below project.

Embarking on this exciting project, I will skillfully orchestrate the setup of a dynamic Jenkins CI/CD pipeline, seamlessly weaving together the powers of Github, Sonarqube, and Docker on a robust AWS EC2 instance.

Guided by Jenkins, a versatile open-source automation server, I will navigate through the intricacies of automating vital software development tasks – from smooth builds and rigorous testing to effortless deployments. Github will stand as my collaborative haven, providing an agile code repository and a platform for seamless teamwork. In parallel, Sonarqube, my code quality sentinel, will meticulously scrutinize and elevate the caliber of my codebase. As the curtains draw close, Docker's innovative containerization prowess will shine, simplifying the deployment of my software applications.

As this project unfolds, the first brushstroke on my canvas will be creating an AWS EC2 instance, the foundation upon which my vision will be brought to life with Jenkins. With finesse, I will sculpt a Github repository, seamlessly intertwining it with Jenkins to achieve a harmonious rhythm of collaboration. My symphony of precision continues as I mastermind Sonarqube's configuration, allowing it to delicately evaluate code quality within my Github sanctuary. In the grand finale, I will artfully craft a Docker image – a masterpiece in encapsulation – that will carry my application into the world, propelled by the prowess of the Jenkins pipeline.

Amidst the journey, I will weave a tapestry of lucid explanations for each step, revealing their pivotal roles in this intricate dance of technology. With carefully curated instructions, I will pave the way for a seamless interplay of these tools, fostering a synergistic partnership. The culmination of this artistic endeavor will yield a living, breathing CI/CD pipeline, a testament to automation's prowess in software development. Its constant pulse will breathe life into the process while guarding the sanctity of code quality.

Feel free to infuse this narrative with your personal touch, molding it to match the unique contours of your project and vision.
